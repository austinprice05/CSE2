//          inside loop (B)
//              use next() to get rid of junk
//              prompt user again
//          exit loop (B) when hasNextInt() returns true
//     exit  loop (A), when an int has been entered and the int is in the range [1,15]
//    now that you have exited with an int between 1 and 15 execute the loop to display
