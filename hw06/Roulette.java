Roulette.java program
For this program, use a random number generator (recall Math.random()) to simulate this personâ€™s
betting on 100 spins, but run the simulation 1000 times and collect data on the outcome.
For 100 spins, if my number comes up 3 or more times, I walk away with 3x$36=$108 or more. 
Thus, if my number comes up at least 3 times I win money; otherwise I lose money. 
For the 1000 repetitions of the 100-spin simulation, compute the number of times I lose everything (my number never comes up), 
compute the total winnings (of all simulations added together), and 
compute the number of times I walked away with a profit in one session of 100 spins of the wheel.
Store the program in the file Roulette.java and store the file in lab06 on Cloud9.
